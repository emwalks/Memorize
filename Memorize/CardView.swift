// SwiftUI Views are immutable!
// "Cannot assign to property: 'self' is immutable"
// Once created the view cannot be changed
// In swiftUI new views are being drawn all the time rather than changing the current one

// The @State var doesn't make the view mutable, it just marks that var to be a pointer in memory -> the pointer value can change but the view doesn't change
